Power Saver Mode brings an iOS9-like power saving switch to disable some features of iOS that aren't required and can be computationally or battery expensive. 

Includes a Flipswitch. 

Other people/tweak makers can make toggles ("plugins") for this by implementing the PSToggleProtocol in their class, then registering an instance of that class with PowerSaver. Take a look at one of the existing toggles for more details. For example if you have a battery intensive tweak (e.g. some sort of UI mod like AquaBoard), you could implement a toggle for this that when turned on would disable AquaBoard.
